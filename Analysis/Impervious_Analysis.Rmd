# Introduction
This Notebook analyzes FOCB's "Surface" data.  In particular, it compares 
observed water quality conditions with the level of nearby impervious surfaces. 
Imperviouos surfaces, like roads, parking areas,a nd rooftops, area reasonable 
surrogate for urbanization, and are used here in that context.

The water quality data are pulled from 23 long term monitoring locations around
the Bay.  The data comes from sites visited regularly by FOCB staff, either by
boat or on land.  The focus is on warm season sampling (April through October),
with roughly monthly samples.  Earlier data from some land-based sites was
collected by volunteers.

Impervious cover values were  based on 2007 impervious cover data,
based on GIS analysis.  Details of the GIS analysis are provided in the
'DATA_NOTES.md' file found with the GIS data in the Derived Data archives.

# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
#dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Primary Data
We specify column names because FOCB data has a row of names, a row of units,
then the data.  This approach is simpler than reading names from the first
row and correcting them to be R syntactic names.
```{r load_data, warning = FALSE}
fn    <- 'FOCB Surface All Current Sites With BSV Data.xlsx'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)

mynames <- c('station', 'dt', 'time', 'sample_depth',
             'secchi', 'water_depth','temperature', 'salinity',
             'do', 'pctsat', 'pH', 'chl', 
             'month', 'year', 'fdom', 'bga', 
             'turbidity', 'blank', 'clouds', 'wndspd',
             'winddir'
             ) 

the_data <- read_excel(fpath, skip=2, col_names = mynames) %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb))

rm(mynames)
```

### Remove 2020 only data
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
select(-c(fdom:winddir))
```

## Add Station Names
```{r}
fn    <- 'FOCB Monitoring Sites.xlsx'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)
loc_data <- read_excel(fpath) %>%
  select(Station_ID, Station_Name) %>%
  rename(station = Station_ID,
         station_name = Station_Name)

the_data <- the_data %>%
  left_join(loc_data, by = 'station') %>%
  relocate(station_name, .after = station) %>%
  
  relocate(year, .after = dt) %>%
  relocate(month, .after = year)
```

Our data contains two stations that are not associated with 
locations that were included in our spatial data.  We can see that because
when we `left_join()` by `station`, no `station_name` value is carried over.
```{r}
l <- the_data %>%
  group_by(station) %>%
  summarize(missing = sum(is.na(station_name))) %>%
  filter(missing > 0) %>%
  pull(station)
l
```

If we look at those records, on is represented by only a single observation, and
the other only by data from 2020.  Neither matter for the current analysis. They
will get filtered out when we select data to describe recent conditions, and 
trends.
```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(station %in% l)
```

## Address Secchi Censored Values
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(secchi_2 = if_else(secchi == "BSV", water_depth, as.numeric(secchi)),
         bottom_flag = secchi == "BSV") %>%
  relocate(secchi_2, .after = secchi) %>%
  relocate(bottom_flag, .after = secchi_2)
```

## Create Recent Data
We filter to the last five FULL years of data, 2015 through 2019.
```{r}
recent_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(year > 2014 & year < 2020) %>%
  mutate(station = fct_reorder(station, temperature, mean, na.rm = TRUE),
         station_name = fct_reorder(station_name, temperature, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Add Impervious Cover Data
```{r folder_refs_2}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
#dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE

fn    <- 'focb_monitoring_imperv.csv'
fpath <- file.path(sibling,fn)

imperv_data <- read_csv(fpath,
                        col_types = cols(
                          FID = col_skip(),
                          Station_ID = col_character(),
                          Station_Na = col_skip(),
                          Town = col_skip(),
                          Y = col_skip(),
                          X = col_skip(),
                          Category = col_skip(),
                          land_1000 = col_double(),
                          imperv_100 = col_skip(),
                          land_500 = col_double(),
                          imperv_500 = col_skip(),
                          land_100 = col_double(),
                          imperv_101 = col_skip(),
                          pct_100 = col_double(),
                          pct_500 = col_double(),
                          pct_1000 = col_double(),
                          pct_l_1000 = col_double(),
                          pct_l_500 = col_double(),
                          pct_l_100 = col_double()
                        )) %>%
  mutate(across(contains('pct-'), function (x) x * 100)) %>%
  rename(station = Station_ID)

recent_data <- recent_data %>%
  left_join(imperv_data, by = 'station')
```

# Create Nested Tibble
To run parallel analyses on nested tibbles, we will need to reorganize the 
data so that we can analyze along parameters. 

```{r}
nested_data <- recent_data %>%
  select(-dt, -year, -time, -sample_depth, 
         -secchi, - bottom_flag, -salinity, -temperature) %>%
  relocate(water_depth, .after = month) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(secchi_2:chl), names_to = 'parameter', values_to = 'value') %>%
  filter(! is.na(value)) %>%
  group_by(parameter) %>%
  nest()
```

# Exploratory Graphics
We have many possible plots here, but we focus on the pct impervious within 
1000 m. 

```{r fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 3.25}
for (p in nested_data$parameter) {
  sel <- nested_data %>%
    filter(parameter == p)
  dat <- sel$data[[1]]

 print(ggplot(dat, aes( x = pct_500, y = value)) +
         stat_summary() +
         #geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
         ylab(p)
 )
       
}

```

None of those look like they hide any strong patterns.



```{r fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 3.25}
for (p in nested_data$parameter) {
  sel <- nested_data %>%
    filter(parameter == p)
  dat <- sel$data[[1]]

 print(ggplot(dat, aes( x = pct_l_1000, y = value)) +
         stat_summary() +
         #geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
         ylab(p)
 )
       
}

```

# Hierarchical Linear Models
We have a fundamentally nested analysis here, with each "Station" acting as a
random exemplar of all possible stations.  We have no variability in
impervious cover within stations, so the appropriate random term is only an
intercept.
```{r}
nested_data <- nested_data %>%
  mutate(lm500 = map(data, function(df) lmer(value ~ pct_500 + month + (1 | station),
                                             REML = FALSE,
                                               data = df)),
         lm_l_500 = map(data, function(df) lmer(value ~ pct_l_500 + month + (1 | station),
                                             REML = FALSE,
                                               data = df)),
         lm1000 = map(data, function(df) lmer(value ~ pct_1000 + month + (1 | station),
                                             REML = FALSE,
                                               data = df)),
         lm_l_1000 = map(data, function(df) lmer(value ~ pct_l_1000 + month + (1 | station),
                                             REML = FALSE,
                                               data = df)))
```

## Review ANOVAs
```{r}
for (p in nested_data$parameter) {
  cat(p)
  cat('\n')
  print(anova(nested_data$lm1000[nested_data$parameter == p][[1]],
              nested_data$lm_l_1000[nested_data$parameter == p][[1]]))
}
```

For all those models the differences between land weighted and total pct cover
within a kilometer are tiny.  WE use the land-scaled IC value as more useful

## 500 Meter IC
### Total Percentage of Nearby IC
```{r}
for (p in nested_data$parameter) {
  cat(p)
  cat('\n')
  print(anova(nested_data$lm500[nested_data$parameter == p][[1]]))
  cat('\n\n')
}
```
Unscaled impervious cover is probably significant for percent saturation. We
need to check significance with better methods.


### Percent Imperviousness on Nearby Land
```{r}
for (p in nested_data$parameter) {
  cat(p)
  cat('\n')
  print(anova(nested_data$lm_l_500[nested_data$parameter == p][[1]]))
  cat('\n\n')
}
```
So, land-scaled impervious percentage at 500m is NOT related to any of our
water quality parameters. 

A similar pattern appears at 1000 meter (Not shown), but with a lower (possibly 
not significant?) F value.


## Near Land Models
Why might the scaling matter?  Perhaps it's not IC, but proximity to land that
matters.  We explore that by looking at Percent Saturation.
```{r}
land_model_500 <-  lmer(pctsat ~ land_500 + month + (1 | station),
                                             REML = FALSE,
                                               data = recent_data)

land_model_1000 <- lmer(pctsat ~ land_1000 + month + (1 | station),
                                             REML = FALSE,
                                               data = recent_data)

```

```{r}
anova(land_model_500)
```


```{r}
anova(land_model_1000)
```

So, nearby land is highly related to percent saturation. Obviously, inshore 
locations have more land nearby than offshore sites, so perhaps all are 
learning is that water quality differs inshore versus offshore.  We already 
knew that, and there are better ways to show that than with a hierarchical
model

# Conclusion
The conclusion is that we see no meaningful relationship between 
imperviousness and these water quality metrics.
